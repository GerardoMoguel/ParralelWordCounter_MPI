============================================================================================
This class generates an individual hashmap of unique words used in each book,
it also generates a "global hashmap" with the words all the books sent.

    This hashmaps are used in the "word counter" algorithms.

This process will be made serial and parallel, because i got curious if it can be paralelized,
and how this affects the execution time.
Thanks for reading.
